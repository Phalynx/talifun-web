= Introduction =

An http handler that will serve static files in a cached, compressed and resumable manner.

It generates consistent etags and the correct meta tags for caching on proxies and locally. This is especially useful when you don't have control over the configuration of the webserver.

It supports the following caching http header tags:

  * Accept-Ranges
  * ETag
  * Expires
  * Last-Modified
  * Range
  * If-Range
  * If-Match
  * If-None-Match
  * If-Modified-Since
  * If-Unmodified-Since
  * Unless-Modified-Since

It can also serve cached requests and compressed cached requests from memory bypassing the hard drive. 

= When to use it =

When you want to serve static files. For example jpg, gif, xls, pdf, mp3, avi.

= Features =

  * Resumable downloads (206 partial)
  * Client side caching (304 not modified): ETags, expires
  * Compression: none, gzip, deflate
  * Cached: stores orginal and compressed content in memory, bypassing hard drive. This can really speed up web requests. Partial conent can be servered from memory too.
